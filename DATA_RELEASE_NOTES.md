# Release notes for the *IAMC 1.5°C Scenario Explorer and Data hosted by IIASA*

This document keeps track of the data changes of the scenario ensemble
compiled in the *IAMC 1.5°C Scenario Explorer and Data hosted by IIASA*.


## Release 1.1

This release includes additional timeseries data to increase reproducibility
of the figures and tables in the IPCC SR15, and it corrects a number of
data issues identified since Release 1.0. None of the changes have
any impact on the assessment in the IPCC SR15.

### Detailed list of changes

 - Reporting error for primary energy from fossils (aggregate) submitted by
   the 'MESSAGE-GLOBIOM 1.0' scenarios as part of the 'EMF33' project.
   See [#1](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/1)
   for details.

 - Typo in a variable name and incorrect values in two timeseries of 
   the reference data from 'IEA Statistics' included in the release.
   See [#2](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/2)
   for details.

 - Missing subsectoral CO2 emissions for scenarios from the SSP, CD-LINKS
   and LED projects.
   See [#3](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/3)
   and [#4](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/4)
   for details.

 - Missing timeseries of harmonized emissions as used for climate impact
   assessment by the MAGICC and FAIR models.
   See [#5](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/5)
   for details.

 - Error in index year for the variable 'Price|Agriculture|*' in scenarios
   submitted by the 'AIM' model.
   See [#7](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/7)
   for details.

 - Missing value for cumulative BECCS in the metadata for
   the 'LowEnergyDemand' scenario submitted by the 'MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM' model.
   See [#9](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/9)
   for details.

 - Incorrect regional data (other than 'World') for scenario submitted
   by the 'POLES' model as part of the 'EMF33' project.
   See [#12](https://github.com/iiasa/ipcc_sr15_scenario_analysis/issues/12)
   for details.
